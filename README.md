### About my games:
- [Head Bumper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1398130/Head_Bumper_Editcraft/ "Head Bumper on Steam"): 2D platformer with built-in level & block editor. The game is integrated with Steam Workshop. Anyone can create their own blocks, upload them to the workshop and then build level using these blocks. Blocks can be configured in many different ways - for a creative person, the possibilities are almost endless. Levels are hosted on my Linux VPS with implemented REST API in .NET Core and MongoDB, while the game itself runs on the Unity engine. The prototype of this game was my engineering thesis.
- [The Bilionerzy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NiebieskiPunkt.TheBilionerzy "The Bilionerzy on Google Play"): This game is parody of "Å»ulionerzy" which is parody of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" - the goal was to create the most absurd quiz game! The game tries to break the convention in all possible ways, one of which is that a question may have more than one correct answer, but you only need to select one, which allows for many creative questions. There are a few other innovations in the game, I do not want to list them all here, but as an example I will tell you that every player and every question has its own elo ranking just like in chess - the ranking of the question helps to determine its difficulty, and the player's ranking shows how good he is. Players can submit their own questions, which are stored on my server, just like the levels in Head Bumper.
- [3D Checkers](https://github.com/kubpica/Laska "Repo of the game"): Checkers variant (originally called Laska) in which pieces, instead of being eliminated from the game, are taken prisoner - the taken piece is placed under the taking one, forming a column. This application allows you to play with AI and friends irl. There is also a position editor, allowing you to place up to 100 pieces on the board in any way you want. You can save the created position and start the game or turn on the "AI vs AI" mode, in which the artificial intelligence will play the game with itself - this way you can organize auto-battles. The implementation of AI for this game was my master's thesis.
- [Chess for idiots](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2121150/Chess_for_idiots/ "Chess for idiots"): The game is both a parody of chess and a Polish political satire. Instead of thinking, just move your pieces in one of the many absurd ways! Weapons in the game: [Blowing](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7137453742441516293 "WarCoins/Blowing"), [Arrow](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7139260305850256645 "WarCoins/Arrow"), [Invisible hand of the market](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7158533795342224646 "WarCoins/HandOfMarket"), [Rocket](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7130350390763064582 "WarCoins/Rocket"), [Inflation](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7140343143546768645 "WarCoins/Inflation"), [Hot Sauce (aka Wino Tuska)](https://www.tiktok.com/@warcoins/video/7143936195507145990 "WarCoins/WinoTuska") & MORE! As a technical fun fact, I can say that I developed my own version of the FEN notation for this game ([about this in polish](https://youtu.be/1M7o_84cxxI?t=559 "YouTube video preseting early stage of the game dev - prototype")). The game is developed on the Unity engine and multiplayer mode using the [FishNet](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet) framework.
